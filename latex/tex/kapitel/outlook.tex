\chapter{Outlook}
This additional chapter briefly addresses the future of the application, which is not currently part of the scope but can still be kept in mind as information.

According to Caruso's CEO, the future of the application can be divided into three phases: The bronze, silver and gold phase.

After the first development phase is completed and the application proves to be useful, in the bronze phase the project will be taken up again by internal development and set up again on a larger scale.

In the silver phase, the application should also be able to be used productively for customers and exceed the scope of \gls{appetiser}.

In the gold phase, the intention is to sell the application as a productive system to customers.
