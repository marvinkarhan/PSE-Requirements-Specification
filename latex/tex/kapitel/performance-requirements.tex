\chapter{Performance Requirements}
For Carvis, extensibility and scalability are key aspects. 
As it is intended to service a wide range of customers with different interests, the ability to add new templates and widgets quickly is crucial.
As Carvis is only used for presentations and possibly by customers for short periods of time, it does not have to accomodate much user traffic.

Limitations in the availability of the \gls{data} are completely on the side of the \gls{api} and \glspl{oem}. Only a steady connection to the \gls{api} must be insured. 
Decision makers are unlikely to spend much time on Carvis by themselves, and likely only in short windows. This makes it all the more important that when they decide to use it that it is running and available.
