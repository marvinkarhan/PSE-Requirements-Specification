\chapter{Performance Requirements}
For this product, extensibility and scalability are key aspects. 
As it is intended to service a wide range of customers with different interests, the ability to add new templates and widgets quickly is crucial.
As the product is only used for presentations and possibly by customers for short periods of time, it does not have to accomodate much user traffic.

Limitations in the availability of data are completely on the side of the Caruso API and OEMs. Only a steady connection to the API must be insured. 
Customers are unlikely to spend much time on the product by themselves, and likely only in short windows. This makes it all the more important that when they decide to use the product that it is running and available.
