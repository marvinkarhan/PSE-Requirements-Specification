\chapter{The \Glspl{stakeholder}}
In this chapter, we will identify the key \glspl{stakeholder} of the project and describe their needs, expectations, and concerns as they relate to the project. By understanding the needs and expectations of our \glspl{stakeholder}, we can ensure that the project meets their requirements and delivers the desired outcomes.

  \label{Kap2:Stakeholders}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{Kap2:Stakeholders} shows the \glspl{stakeholder} of the project. \Glspl{stakeholder} are separated into three categories: the core target group, direct \glspl{stakeholder} and indirect \glspl{stakeholder}. The core target group are the main beneficiaries of Carvis, the people who are intended to use the product. The direct \glspl{stakeholder} are people and organisations who are linked to the project. They either work on the project or provide critical information without which it could not succeed. The indirect \glspl{stakeholder} are people and organisations who also profit from the success of the project but have no direct impact on it.

\section{Core Target Group}
The core target group consists of three \glspl{stakeholder}: the Caruso sales employee, the Caruso configurator and the decision maker of a potential customer company. The following sections will present the obligations of each \gls{stakeholder} and explain their relevance to the project.

\subsection{The Sales Employee}
The Caruso sales employee is a representative of Caruso who negotiates and closes contracts with decision makers of other companies and sells them Caruso services. Their obligations include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the acquisition of customers,
  \item the preparation of sales pitches for decision makers,
  \item the presentation of the sales pitch to build the decision maker's trust in Caruso data,
  \item the answering of any remaining questions the decision maker may have,
  \item and the closing of contracts with decision makers.
\end{itemize}
The Caruso sales employee is essential both in the current and the planned future process of acquiring new customers. They were the main point of contact for questions during the design process.

\subsection{The Decision Maker}
Decision makers are potential customers of Caruso which are interested in the data provided. They are often the executives of medium-sized companies which hope to improve the workflow in their company or develop new applications using Caruso data. According to Caruso, the most profitable customers are insurance companies, roadside assistance companies and fleet management companies. During the design process, contact to the decision makers wasn't established directly but their wishes were expressed by the sales employee. Still, their interests are a core driver in the design of the product as it is ultimately intended to convince them to invest in Caruso services. They:
\begin{itemize}
  \item decide whether or not to enter into contracts with Caruso on behalf of their companies,
  \item often have little technical know-how,
  \item and will only buy a product whose value they appreciate and which they trust.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Configurator}
The Caruso configurator is an employee which aggregates customer data into an Excel or HTML report. They have technological skill and will prepare the data for sales pitches at the request of the sales employee. Their obligations are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the aggregation of vehicle data,
  \item the creation of Excel or HTML reports,
  \item and the manual configuration of reports to accommodate a decision maker's individual requests and wishes.
\end{itemize}
After the successful conclusion of this project, the configurator will have a much smaller role or will not be needed at all as Carvis will automatically aggregate the required data and will provide an interface for the sales employee to configure it without needing technical know-how. The configurator is still part of the core target group because they are currently responsible for creating all forms of visualisation for the decision maker.

\section{Other \Glspl{stakeholder}}
The other \glspl{stakeholder} of the project are the direct and indirect \glspl{stakeholder}. As they are not directly responsible for any requirements of the project, they will not be mentioned in the following chapters and will only briefly be described here.

\subsection{Direct \Glspl{stakeholder}}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The eight eyes Team}: The eight eyes team has identified Caruso's wishes and the requirements for an application to fulfil them. This resulting document will provide developers the basis for a successful project.
  \item \textbf{The Professors}: The professors established the first contact to Caruso and organised the central aspects of the project as part of the PSE course.
  \item \textbf{The \glspl{oem}}: The \glspl{oem} provide the raw vehicle data which Caruso buys and standardises. Without them, this project would not be possible.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Indirect \Glspl{stakeholder}}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The Shareholders}: The shareholders invest in Caruso and thus profit from any new contracts that may be closed as a result of the success of this project.
  \item \textbf{The Competition}: The competition are companies which offer similar services to Caruso. They will be negatively impacted by this success of the project.
  \item \textbf{The Drivers}: The drivers are the customers of the decision makers. They will profit if the further use of Caruso data leads to better customer service or new applications they might use.
  \item \textbf{The Caruso Development Team} The development team will expand and maintain the Carvis system in the future.
  \item \textbf{The Data Security Officer}: Data security officers handle the security of Caruso data. Caruso cares about the security of their customer data, however according to Caruso it should not be a priority for the purposes of this project.
\end{itemize}

\section{\Glspl{persona}}
A representative \gls{persona} has been created for each \gls{stakeholder} of the core target group to better understand and gain deeper insight into their challenges. These \glspl{persona} include demographic information, a job description, goals, aspirations and challenges they face at work. It also describes how Carvis will support them to overcome their challenges and meet their goals.

  \label{Persona:Cornelius}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{Persona:Cornelius} shows "Cornelius von Gr端nwald" who is representative of the sales employee. As such it is his job to acquire new customers and hold presentations to showcase Caruso data. He has little technical know-how and relies on developers (configurators) to prepare data for him. He prioritises building trust between himself and his customers and values their individual wishes.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics*[width=\textwidth]{./Rube.pdf}
  \caption{\Gls{persona}: Decision Maker}
  \label{Persona:Rube}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{Persona:Rube} shows "R端diger R端be" who is representative of the decision maker of a fleet management company. He is the CEO of a medium-sized taxi company called EuroTaxi. He is interested in expanding his business with innovative technologies, however he needs to first be convinced of their use as every investment is a big risk in terms of time and resources spent. As he  has little technical knowledge and little time, \glspl{data} need to be presented in a simple and engaging way. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics*[width=\textwidth]{./annie.pdf}
  \caption{\Gls{persona}: Configurator}
  \label{Persona:Annie}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{Persona:Annie} shows "Annie Ainsley" who is representative of the configurator. She is a senior Caruso developer who is intimately familiar with the \gls{api} and \glspl{data}. She is often asked by Cornelius to prepare data for him which takes time away for other tasks. She is also not familiar with R端diger or other decision makers and can't cater to their wishes well, so she has to be in close contact with Cornelius while she prepares the data for him.
