\chapter{Functional Requirements}
User stories were created to collect the requirements to Carvis. They consist of a stakeholder of the core target group and their wishes and goals. The following tables include the requirements grouped by their stakeholder. Every user story has an id and a reference to associated use cases. They also have descriptions to present any details that are relevant. The user stories are prioritised according to the MoSCoW method into must, should and could have.
