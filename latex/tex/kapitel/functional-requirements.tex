\chapter{Functional Requirements}

\Glspl{userstory} were created to collect the requirements of Carvis. They consist of a \gls{stakeholder} of the core target group and their wishes and goals. The following tables include the requirements grouped by their \gls{stakeholder}. Every \gls{userstory} has an id and a reference to associated use cases. They also have descriptions to present any details that are relevant. The \glspl{userstory} are prioritised according to the \gls{moscow} into \enquote{must have}, \enquote{should have} and \enquote{could have}. There are no \enquote{will not have} stories. \enquote{Must} stories are required for the success of the project, allowing the presentation of visualised data items for the decision maker. \enquote{Should} stories improve the workflow and further assist the presentation of data items, but are not required. \enquote{Could} criteria are nice-to-have features.
