To implement the map in Carvis, there are a variety of ready-made solutions which can be included.
These include, but are not limited to, the following options:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://leafletjs.com/}{Leaflet}
    \item \href{https://developers.google.com/maps/apis-by-platform}{Google Maps}
    \item \href{https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API_v0.6}{OpenStreetMap}
    \item \href{https://www.mapbox.com/}{MapBox}
\end{itemize}

For all of these solutions, it is important to analyze their cost, their benefit, and if they can be used for the purposes required by the map of this application:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Showing a live location of one or multiple vehicles
    \item Opening a popup window when clicking a location
    \item Showing one or multiple routes with colours and colour gradients
    \item Basic panning and zooming
\end{itemize}
